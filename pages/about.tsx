        <p>Hey, Iâ€™m Khang. I'm a developer, athlete, and student of math.</p>
        <p>
          I am a believer in the power of fundamentals. I love working with
          low-level development tools, and I derive meaning from building
          learning resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in urban Singapore and currently go to school at the
          National University of Singapore, studying towards a degree in
          Mathematics. I spend my free time slipping and sliding in vim,
          building websites, and enjoying time with friends and family.
