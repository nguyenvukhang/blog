Studying for A Levels
I used to make instrumental covers of songs
Why I use Arch {{{
I love the package manager.
I love how fast it boots up.
I love the amount of control it gives the user over the system.
I love how close to nothing extra is installed on the system.
Things I still think about when I use arch
  having an intuitive image editor (like Affinity Photo)
  having decent battery life (macOS is still far ahead in power management)
