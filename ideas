Studying for A Levels
I used to make instrumental covers of songs
My experience installing Arch Linux {{{
After installing an using vim relatively comfortably, I built up a certain
confidence. I was already looking for my next challenge.

From internet memes I knew vaguely of this operating system: Arch Linux.
Everyone was making fun about how unstable it is, how difficult it is to
install, and most of all how every Arch user has the insatiable urge to tell
people that they use Arch Linux. It has come to the point where "I use Arch btw"
has become a meme of its own.

[recognize that I fall under that category]

When I was done installing arch all I had was a terminal
That's what I logged in to.
When I turned on my computer all it showed me was a black screen with
{description} and an expectant blinking cursor waiting for my username.

I love the package manager.
I love how fast it boots up.
I love the amount of control it gives the user over the system.
I love how close to nothing extra is installed on the system.
Things I still think about when I use arch
  having an intuitive image editor (like Affinity Photo)
  having decent battery life (macOS is still far ahead in power management)
