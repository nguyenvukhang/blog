Philosophy, thinking about thinking {{{
maturity is realising that things can be broken down.
realising that what was permanent is not
realising that what were rules are actually only guidelines
or that realising what was a constant is actually a variable.
the ability to make finer adjustments
the ability to think at a higher resolution
