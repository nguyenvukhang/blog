What happens after installing Arch Linux
  [./ideas/after-installing-arch.mdx] {{{
First things first, I installed a display server and a window manager. This
enabled me to launch firefox.

Since I still foresee myself using an internet browser and watching Netflix, the
first thing I did was to install a gui
I loved it, how clean it was.

Since then, I've handpicked packages to install, from a window manager to a
wallpaper setter 

I love the package manager.
I love how fast it boots up.
I love the amount of control it gives the user over the system.
I love how close to nothing extra is installed on the system.
Things I still think about when I use arch
  having an intuitive image editor (like Affinity Photo)
  having decent battery life (macOS is still far ahead in power management)
