I'm sure that some people, especially those who live near the borders of Tiong
Bahru, will believe strongly that they live either in Tiong Bahru or outside of
it, but fuck it.

Walking through the neighbourhoods of Tiong Bahru and flying by with the aid of
Google Earth, I observe that within Tiong Bahru, the quality of housing is
rather similar.

There were also no cars that stood out as significantly more expensive than the
rest.

Outline {
  Thoughts on Tiong Bahru before going {
    I've never been there before
    I know roughly that it is pretty central, very short distance away from CBD

  Thoughts after I've gone to Tiong Bahru {

  Core Focus {
    For this article, I will be primarily discussing the state of housing in
    Tiong Bahru, from the lens of a person evaluating the level of social
    inequality.
  }
  Physical Observations {
    went up to the top floor of a 30-storey HDB and had a look.
    [
      on one side there were a series of very short, three-storey HDBs which
      sprawled across the east side of Tiong Bahru;
      an occasionally there were very modern-looking condominiums with exotic
      designs.
    ]
    Tiong Bahru has a rather flat terrain, so there's no possibility of having a
    "big house on the top of the hill" kind of cliche.
    There is a rather large park at the west end.
    And a school
  }
  Online Observations {
    Large disparity in housing prices even within Tiong Bahru
    Property prices within Tiong Bahru alone range from $300,000 for a 700 sq ft
    HDB to $6,000,000 condominium apartment. This suggests that even within
    Tiong Bahru, people can be in completely different income levels.

    In terms of accessibility of each house to the hub of Tiong Bahru (the MRT
    itself), all are quite decent. The furthest anyone has to walk to a bus stop
    is 300m, which isn't even one round around the Olympic track.

  Evaluation of if housing alone is a good representation of income disparity {
    On one hand, if a person inherited a house from his or her parents, the
    house itself may not be a good representation of his or her actual financial
    position.

    but for households such as condominiums, they tend to have a monthly
    maintenance fee which tend to have a direct relationship with the value of
    the property. So these still suggests a significant income disparity within
    Tiong Bahru.

  Hedge {
    I don't live there
    Only spent half a day there
    There must still be a lot of nuances about Tiong Bahru that I don't know {
      Like how good each home clinic is, if there is any discrimination
      Or the food options there, and if they are skewed towards any cuisine
    }
    Other possible indicators of social inequality. {
      How people are treated based on their race within Tiong Bahru
