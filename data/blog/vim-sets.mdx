# Configuring vimrc

Unlike most applications with a graphical settings menu, vim's settings are configured inside of a **vimrc** file. But where do you find/put this file?

If you're in neovim, you can drop it in <pre>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</pre>
And if you're in regular vim, you can place it in <pre>~/.vim/vimrc/</pre>

This is my [vimrc](https://github.com/nguyenvukhang/neovim/blob/master/init.vim). But for this discussion I'll be focusing on configuring vim from its original state.

So here's the minimal state of a nicely-working vimrc:
```
set tabstop=2
set softtabstop=2
set expandtab
set shiftwidth=2
set wrap linebreak
set breakindent
set relativenumber
set number
set incsearch
set nohlsearch
set hidden
set noswapfile
set nobackup
set scrolloff=10
set undofile
set undodir=~/.config/nvim/undodir
set termguicolors
set guicursor=
set noerrorbells
set autochdir
```

`set tabstop=2` makes something happen
