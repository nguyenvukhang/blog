I grew up learning how to type on the standard QWERTY layout, which looked
something like this:

<CenteredImage

  alt="Photo"
  width={830}
  height={290}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

But I realised that typing on such a keyboard forces your hands to be very close
to each other. This in turn makes you tend to hunch over your keyboard or roll
your shoulders inwards when you type.

So in pursuit of ergonomics and also largely due to the cool factor, I bought
myself a split keyboard. A split keyboard is a two-piece keyboard, so you can
place the two halves as far away from each other as you want. This way, you can
have each hand at their natural resting position of shoulder-width apart.

In particular, I got the [Iris
model](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard). Apart
from being a split keyboard, it also slightly realigned the keys such that they
were in-line vertically while staggered horizontally such that the home row
follows the natural curve of your fingers.

I had to relearn a lot of finger movements in this new layout. For one, I used
to hit <Kbd>B</Kbd> with my right hand, but now I'm forced to use my left hand.
I also used to hit <Kbd>C</Kbd> with by left index, but now I have to mentally
remap that to my left middle finger.

Not to mention it has less keys than a normal keyboard,
so symbols like <Kbd>[</Kbd>, <Kbd>]</Kbd>, <Kbd>{'{'}</Kbd>, and <Kbd>}</Kbd>
had to be binded to chords (with my custom modifier at the right
thumb: <Kbd>↑</Kbd>).

So to type braces on my keyboard, I needed to do these:

- to get <Kbd>[</Kbd>, I press <Kbd>↑ + o</Kbd>.
- to get <Kbd>]</Kbd>, I press <Kbd>↑ + p</Kbd>.
- to get <Kbd>{'{'}</Kbd>, I press <Kbd>↑ + Shift + o</Kbd>.
- to get <Kbd>}</Kbd>, I press <Kbd>↑ + Shift + p</Kbd>.

To program the keyboard, I use [qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). It
grants me full control over the keyboard, so I can do my own cool stuff like
press a special key combination to play some epic music track or something.

Notice how I don't have an enter key where it is commonly placed.
I mapped the <Kbd>Pg Dn</Kbd> key at my left thumb to enter. This has given
my formerly useless left thumb a new purpose, and I've found this one of the
most pleasing changes. My keyboard layout is [open-source](https://github.com/nguyenvukhang/qmk_firmware/blob/46a55b73f4bb899ec8e86f22e0cc487e3010f473/keyboards/keebio/iris/keymaps/khang/keymap.c),
so feel free to check it out and make it your own.

I really enjoy the reduced hand movement as a result of the keys all being
closer to the home row, coupled with the greater engagement of the thumbs. While
it took some time to get used to, learning this new layout has been a rewarding
experience. I got more familiar with where each key is, thanks to the more
organized layout, and I can type faster on this than on a standard keyboard now.
