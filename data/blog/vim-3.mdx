There are two main modes in which you will be in vim: Normal and Insert. Most of
your movement will be done in Normal mode, and your editing in Insert. In this
post I will be talking about different ways of entering and exiting Insert mode.

# Entering Insert Mode

First off: your standard ways of entering Insert mode: <Kbd>i</Kbd> (insert)
and <Kbd>a</Kbd> (append). <Kbd>i</Kbd> lets you start inserting text to the
left of the character you were previously on, while <Kbd>a</Kbd> puts you on the
right of the character you were on. <Kbd>a</Kbd> is useful when you want to
append text to the end of the line.

The following methods will allow you to slip into Insert mode so fast you
won't even realise it. Get used to these, and you're in for some real speed.

## o is for oh snap

So next, we have <Kbd>o</Kbd>. This key alone is a big reason why I find it so hard
to go back to a point-and-click text editor. With your cursor anywhere on a line
in Normal mode, pressing <Kbd>o</Kbd> will create a new line under that,
properly indented, and put you in Insert mode. From anywhere in the line! You
no longer have to go to the end and press enter. Just go to the line,
press <Kbd>o</Kbd>, and you're good to go.

### upper-case alter-egos

Now all of these keys have their upper case versions. <Kbd>I</Kbd> puts you in
Insert mode to the left of the first character of that line, and <Kbd>A</Kbd>
puts you in Insert mode to the right of the last character of that line. This is
useful when you want to pre-pend or append things to the whole line.

And <Kbd>O</Kbd> does the same thing as <Kbd>o</Kbd>, except it's on the line
above.

### c is for change

The next big thing is <Kbd>c</Kbd>. Let's say you want to change a word with
another word. You would first go to the front of the word, press `dw` to delete
the word, then press `i` and type in the new word. With <Kbd>c</Kbd>, you can
press `cw` and accomplish the same task as `dwi`. I remember `cw` as "change
word." The neat thing is: you can pair <Kbd>c</Kbd> with any verbs!

* `ciw` will change the word your cursor is on (doesn't need to be at the front)
* `ci'` will delete the text inside single quotes and put you in Insert mode.
* `ca(` will delete the text inside the parentheses, including the parentheses,
  and put you in Insert mode.

(you can think of `ci` as "change in something" and `ca` as "change around
something")

ways to exit insert mode {
  press escape
  remap your caps lock key to escape for easier access
  remap some other key combination to escape (some people to jj, some do jk)
}
