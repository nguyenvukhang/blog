My vim jouney - part 1

# Motivation to move from a normal text editor to vim.

For a long while, I've been using Sublime Text 3 extensively.
I coded on it, took notes on it, planned events on it.
I loved it because it was one of the few apps I had where I can install extensions to customize the look and feel of the app,
but also mostly because it was fast.

As time went by, I felt that the configuration options open to me were not granular enough.
Customization was limited to what the endpoints which the developers left open.
Documentation also lagged far behind features.

and the large letters in caps "UNREGISTERED" did not help with the experience.
$99 for a text editor just didn't make sense.

At the time, I was vaguely aware through pop culture and memes that there are two somewhat legendary editors: Vim and Emacs
I knew that if you googled "vi", Google would ask if you meant "emacs", and vice versa.

And so that's how I got into using vim.


# Starting in vim

Starting state, starting mentality
* that plugins are bad
* that I should avoid them as much as possible

Even then, there are a few plugins that I just couldn't do without:
auto-pairs
onedark colorscheme
ultisnips
